# Real State Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a comprehensive step-by-step process for building a real estate price prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model predicts home prices in Bangalore, India, based on various features such as the square footage area, number of bedrooms, etc.

### Project Overview:-
- Utilized Python, Numpy, and Pandas for data loading and cleaning.<br>
- Employed Matplotlib for data visualization.<br>
- Used Sklearn for model building with linear regression.<br>
- Applied various data science concepts such as outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation.

### Technology Stack:-
+ **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis and model building.<br>	
+ **Numpy and Pandas:** Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.	<br>
+ **Matplotlib:** Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.	<br>
+ **Scikit-Learn (Sklearn):** Library for machine learning, providing simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.<br>	
+ **Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code:** Environment for writing and running Python code.	<br>
